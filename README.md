This is a data visualization project which depicts whether COVID-19 lockdown provided any relief
to the adverse effects of climate change. Human movement was brought to a complete halt with the
pandemic wrecking havoc in the world. No human mobility meant less automobile pollutants, lower fossil
fuel consumption, among other things. You only had to look to the lucid Kathmandu skies to see the affect of lockdown.
But is it enough ? Does the data show any significant findings ? To find out, see this [Jupyter notebook](./Space-apps.ipynb).
